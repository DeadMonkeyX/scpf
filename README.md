# scpf #

Copy folders over ssh like a crazy maniac.

> We all know that scp is verry good for files, but like every other utility it does 1 file at a time.
> This is okay for files, but not for large folder containing hundres of files. like a website and such
> This is what I aim to solve with scpf.
